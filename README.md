#### Project status: _Early development stages_

## Project intro
This project is focused on clean code base and on learning new things like VFX graph and addressables.

## About the game
This game is all about sounds. There is no 3D or 2D world visible to the player just sounds and flowing particles showing the basic orientation sounds.

## Orientation sounds
These string instruments playing notes A5,F5,F5,A4,F4,A3,F3 and D3 in 8 directions. How loud is each note is how close is an object/wall in that direction.

Note C5 on piano then works as a radar. The faster and louder it plays, the closer is player to desired point.

## Focus ability
Other then that, the world will be filled with different sound and it will be hard to know where each sound is coming from. This is what focus is for. Player turns on focus ability and then hears only one sound at a time (not all sound can be focused on, just the important ones)
